## What do we had to do?
This homework was about Convolutional Neural Networks in Pytorch.

## How to check our results?
Follow these steps:

- clone this repo to your device: `git clone https://github.com/rom42pla/aml_hw3.git; cd aml_hw3`
- if you don't have the `datasets` folder, download them with `bash get_datasets.sh` and put them in a folder called `dataset`, if they're not inside it
- check the results of the various tasks: `python ex3_convnet.py; python ex3_pretrained.py`

The latter will popup all the plots on screen and the standard output to the console.
